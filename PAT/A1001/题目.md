Calculate a + b and output the sum in standard format -- that is, the digits must be separated into groups of three by commas (unless there are less than four digits).

**Input**

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains a pair of integers a and b where -1000000 <= a, b <= 1000000. The numbers are separated by a space.

**Output**

For each test case, you should output the sum of a and b in one line. The sum must be written in the standard format.

**Sample Input**

    -1000000 9

**Sample Output**

    -999,991
